[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddingo_input_interfacing.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "dingo_input_interfacing", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "dingo_input_interfacing" with any of the following names:

    dingo_input_interfacingConfig.cmake
    dingo_input_interfacing-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "dingo_input_interfacing" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "dingo_input_interfacing_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "dingo_input_interfacing" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
