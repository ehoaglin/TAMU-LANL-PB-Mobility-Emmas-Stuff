[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddingo_control_msg.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "dingo_control_msg", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "dingo_control_msg"
  with any of the following names:

    dingo_control_msgConfig.cmake
    dingo_control_msg-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "dingo_control_msg" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "dingo_control_msg_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "dingo_control_msg" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
